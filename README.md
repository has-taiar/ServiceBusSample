Sample Code for Sending and Receiving messages over Service Bus 1.0 for Windows Server

This Repository is for demonstrating and giving a jump start for using Service Bus for Windows Server 1.0

There are two solutions, one as a Sender and another as a Receiver. 

You need to install you Service Bus first before you try running the applications. 

Both (Sender and Receiver apps) are console apps that display messages when sent or received. The idea is to show you how easy it is to send and receive messages over Service Bus. 

This apps makes use of Service Bus 1.0 Nuget Package. An emphasis on the 1.0 because there was a compatibility issue when I tried to use the 1.1 version of the Nuget package. 

To set up Service Bus, follow the instructions here (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/jj193021(v=azure.10).aspx)

If you are having problems getting it running, shot me a message and I will get back to you as soon as I can. 

Happy Service Bussing :)
